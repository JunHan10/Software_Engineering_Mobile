An app that allows people to lend each other items, whether it is a hammer or tractor. There is a credit system that indicates how reliable someone is when they borrow something from you. The user will need to register, login, be able to search the item they want, add it to their wishlist(or whatever). Or just browse through a bunch of items, the app could potentially track what sort of items the user is interested in and show recommendations of similar items...
